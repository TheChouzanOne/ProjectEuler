# Project Euler
In this repo I will push all my solutions for project euler problems that I might solve in my spare time. It is organized in folders for every problem and the main language for easy problems will be Python 3 (as it is easy to program). However, more complex problems might be written in C++ for performance.

Also, I will sometimes try functional approaches to solve these problems.

## Please try the problems before you take a look at the solutions.
